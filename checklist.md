## Class and Object in Python

In `contacts/models.py`, the `Contact` **class** represents a Contact **object**.

## UnitTests

Within `tests/test_manager`, **UnitTests** are utlized to ensure the program is operating properly. The `run_tests` script also allows these tests to be run.

## Decorators

(how to define a class as a decorator?)

Within `contacts/models.py`, the Contact class includes an `@total_ordering` **decorator** which provides the remaining comparator functions using the provided `__eq__` and `__lt__` functions.
